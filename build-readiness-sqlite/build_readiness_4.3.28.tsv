"Purpose: We want to reduce platform-related runtime issues and improve consistency by building as many SSIS ENT Master solution components as possible in x86 (instead of Mixed Platforms / Any CPU ), ensuring DLL outputs align with an x86 runtime environment. Risk & Impact: If fixed: Builds become more consistent and aligned with x86 runtime expectations; reduces DLL architecture mismatch issues. If unfixed: Continued risk of architecture-related runtime failures (BadImageFormat/missing load issues) and inconsistent deployment behavior. Scope of Work: Create/adjust build configuration so the solution builds using x86 . Replace Any CPU / Mixed Platforms with x86 where feasible across all projects in the solution. Ensure resulting DLL outputs are x86 (or otherwise explicitly confirmed compatible with x86 runtime). Perform a test build and document outcomes.
