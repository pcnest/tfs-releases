If unfixed: Continued risk of architecture-related runtime failures (BadImageFormat/missing load issues) and inconsistent deployment behavior. Scope of Work: Create/adjust build configuration so the solution builds using x86 . Replace Any CPU / Mixed Platforms with x86 where feasible across all projects in the solution. Ensure resulting DLL outputs are x86 (or otherwise explicitly confirmed compatible with x86 runtime). Perform a test build and document outcomes.
